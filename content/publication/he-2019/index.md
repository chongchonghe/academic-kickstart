abstract = "We present a large set of radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in self-gravitating, turbulent molecular clouds, modeling the formation of individual massive stars, including their UV radiation feedback. We consider a grid of simulations varying the cloud masses between $m\\_{gas}=10^3$ M$\\_\\odot$ to $3 \\times 10^5$ M$\\_\\odot$, and resolving scales between 200 AU to 2000 AU. We consider molecular clouds with gas mean number densities typical of those observed in the local universe ($\\overline n\\_{gas} \\sim 1.8\\times 10^2$ cm$^{-3}$) and denser molecular clouds ($\\overline n\\_{gas} \\sim 1.8 \\times 10^3$ cm$^{-3}$ and $1.8 \\times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) expected to exist, according to cosmological simulations, in high-redshift galaxies. We also partially explore varying the gas metallicity. <br>&emsp; In this paper, the first of a series, we focus on the analysis of the initial mass function (IMF), the star formation rate (SFR), and the total star formation efficiency (TSFE) in molecular clouds . These are the main results: i) We find that the observed Salpeter power-law slope and normalisation of the stellar IMF at the high-mass end can be reproduced if we assume that each star-forming gas clump (sink particle) fragments into stars producing on average a maximum stellar mass about $40\\%$ of the mass of the sink particle, while the remaining $60\\%$ is distributed into smaller mass stars. This empirical prescription, and an IMF reproducing a Chabrier IMF, can be obtained assuming that the sinks fragment according to a power-law mass function flatter than Salpeter, with log-slope $\\Gamma\\sim 0.8$. This result is in agreement with the observed mass function of dense cores in some molecular clouds. ii) The star formation law that best describes our set of simulation is $d\\rho\\_\\star/dt \\propto \\rho\\_{gas}^{1.5}$ if $\\overline{n}\\_{gas}\\<n\\_{cri}\\approx 10^3$ cm$^{-3}$, and $d\\rho\\_\\star/dt \\propto \\rho\\_{gas}^{2.5}$ if $\\overline n\\_{gas}\\>n\\_{cri}$. The duration of the star formation episode of roughly $6$ sound crossing times of the cloud radius (with $c\\_s=10$ km/s). iii) For gas at solar metallicity the TSFE in the cloud is $f\\_\\star=2\\% (m\\_{gas}/10^4 M\\_\\odot)^{0.4}(1+\\overline n\\_{gas}/n\\_{cri})^{0.91}$, also in agreement with (ii). At metallicity $Z<0.1$ Z$\\_\\odot$, $f\\_\\star$ is reduced by a factor of $\\sim$ 5, but this effect needs to be confirmed with larger samples."
