# abstract = "We present radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in self-gravitating, turbulent molecular clouds, modelling the formation of individual massive stars, including their UV radiation feedback. The set of simulations have cloud masses between mgas = 103 M⊙ and 3 × 105 M⊙ and gas densities typical of clouds in the local Universe ($øverlinen_m̊ gas ∼ 1.8times 10^2$ cm−3) and 10× and 100× denser, expected to exist in high-redshift galaxies. The main results are as follows. (i) The observed Salpeter power-law slope and normalization of the stellar initial mass function at the high-mass end can be reproduced if we assume that each star-forming gas clump (sink particle) fragments into stars producing on average a maximum stellar mass about $40  ̊per cent$ of the mass of the sink particle, while the remaining $60 rp̊er cent$ is distributed into smaller mass stars. Assuming that the sinks fragment according to a power-law mass function flatter than Salpeter, with log-slope 0.8, satisfy this empirical prescription. (ii) The star formation law that best describes our set of simulation is $rm̊ρ*̊/rm d̊t ∝ ρ _̊rm gas̊^1.5$ if $øverlinen_rm gas̊łt n_rm cri̊approx 10^3$ cm−3, and $rm do̊ _*/r̊m dt o̊pto ρ _rmåŝ5̊$ otherwise. The duration of the star formation episode is roughly six cloud’s sound crossing times (with cs = 10 km s−1). (iii) The total star formation efficiency in the cloud is $f_*=2 rm per cent̊ (m_rm gas/10^4~m̊athrmM_ødot)^0.4(1+øverlinen_rm gas/n_m̊ cri)^0.9̊$, for gas at solar metallicity, while for metallicity Z &lt; 0.1 Z⊙, based on our limited sample, f* is reduced by a factor of ∼5. (iv) The most compact and massive clouds appear to form globular cluster progenitors, in the sense that star clusters remain gravitationally bound after the gas has been expelled."
