I am a PhD student at UMD working with Prof. Massimo Ricotti to study
the formation and evolution of compact star clusters. I use a
state-of-art radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code _RAMSES-RT_ to
simulate star formation from molecular clouds in the early
universe. In particular, I am looking to understand the role of the
first dense star clusters in the production of supermassive black hole
seeds and in the reionization of the universe.
