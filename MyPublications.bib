    abstract = "{We present radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in self-gravitating, turbulent molecular clouds, modelling the formation of individual massive stars, including their UV radiation feedback. The set of simulations have cloud masses between mgas = 103 M⊙ and 3 × 105 M⊙ and gas densities typical of clouds in the local Universe (\\$\\overline\\{n\\}\_\\{\\rm gas\\} \\sim 1.8\\times 10^2\\$ cm−3) and 10× and 100× denser, expected to exist in high-redshift galaxies. The main results are as follows. (i) The observed Salpeter power-law slope and normalization of the stellar initial mass function at the high-mass end can be reproduced if we assume that each star-forming gas clump (sink particle) fragments into stars producing on average a maximum stellar mass about \\$40\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ of the mass of the sink particle, while the remaining \\$60\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ is distributed into smaller mass stars. Assuming that the sinks fragment according to a power-law mass function flatter than Salpeter, with log-slope 0.8, satisfy this empirical prescription. (ii) The star formation law that best describes our set of simulation is \\$\\{\\rm d\\}\\rho \_*/\\{\\rm d\\}t \\propto \\rho \_\\{\\rm gas\\}^\\{1.5\\}\\$ if \\$\\overline\\{n\\}\_\\{\\rm gas\\}\\lt n\_\\{\\rm cri\\}\\approx 10^3\\$ cm−3, and \\$\\{\\rm d\\}\\rho \_*/\\{\\rm d\\}t \\propto \\rho \_\\{\\rm gas\\}^\\{2.5\\}\\$ otherwise. The duration of the star formation episode is roughly six cloud’s sound crossing times (with cs = 10 km s−1). (iii) The total star formation efficiency in the cloud is \\$f\_*=2\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\} (m\_\\{\\rm gas\\}/10^4~\\mathrm\\{M\\}\_\\odot)^\\{0.4\\}(1+\\overline\\{n\\}\_\\{\\rm gas\\}/n\_\\{\\rm cri\\})^\\{0.91\\}\\$, for gas at solar metallicity, while for metallicity Z \\&lt; 0.1 Z⊙, based on our limited sample, f* is reduced by a factor of ∼5. (iv) The most compact and massive clouds appear to form globular cluster progenitors, in the sense that star clusters remain gravitationally bound after the gas has been expelled.}",

	Abstract = {Emission from neutron stars and accretion disks in low-mass X-ray binaries is anisotropic. The non-spherical shape of the disk as well as blocking of the neutron star by the disk make the observed flux dependent on the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight. This is of importance for the interpretation of thermonuclear X-ray bursts from neutron stars. Because part of the X-ray burst is reflected off the disk, the observed burst flux depends on the anisotropies for both direct emission from the neutron star and reflection off the disk. This influences measurements of source distance, mass accretion rate, and constraints on the neutron star's equation of state. Previous predictions of the anisotropy factors assumed a geometrically flat disk. Detailed observations of two so-called superbursts allowed for the direct and the reflected burst fluxes to each be measured separately. The reflection fraction was much higher than what the anisotropies of a flat disk can account for. We create numerical models to calculate the anisotropy factors for different disk shapes, including concave disks. We present the anisotropy factors of the direct and reflected burst fluxes separately, as well as the anisotropy of the persistent flux. Reflection fractions substantially larger than unity are produced in the case where the inner accretion disk increases steeply in height, such that part of the star is blocked from view. Such a geometry could possibly be induced by the X-ray burst if X-ray heating causes the inner disk to puff up.},
