  Abstract = {We present a large set of radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of star formation in self-gravitating, turbulent molecular clouds, modelling the formation of individual massive stars, including their UV radiation feedback. We consider a grid of simulations varying the cloud masses between $m_{\rm gas}=10^3$~M$_\odot$ to $3 \times 10^5$~M$_\odot$, and resolving scales between 200~AU to 2000~AU. We consider molecular clouds with gas mean number densities typical of those observed in the local universe ($\overline n_{\rm gas} \sim 1.8\times 10^2$~cm$^{-3}$) and denser molecular clouds ($\overline n_{\rm gas} \sim 1.8 \times 10^3$~cm$^{-3}$ and $1.8 \times 10^4$~cm$^{-3}$) expected to exist, according to cosmological simulations, in high-redshift galaxies. We also partially explore varying the gas metallicity. In this paper, the first of a series, we focus on the analysis of the initial mass function (IMF), the star formation rate (SFR), and the total star formation efficiency (TSFE) in molecular clouds . These are the main results: {\it i}) We find that the observed Salpeter power-law slope and normalisation of the stellar IMF at the high-mass end can be reproduced if we assume that each star-forming gas clump (sink particle) fragments into stars producing on average a maximum stellar mass about $40\%$ of the mass of the sink particle, while the remaining $60\%$ is distributed into smaller mass stars. This empirical prescription, and an IMF reproducing a Chabrier IMF, can be obtained assuming that the sinks fragment according to a power-law mass function flatter than Salpeter, with log-slope $\Gamma\sim 0.8$. This result is in agreement with the observed mass function of dense cores in some molecular clouds. {\it ii}) The star formation law that best describes our set of simulation is $d\rho_*/dt \propto \rho_{\rm gas}^{1.5}$ if $\overline n_{\rm gas}<n_{\rm cri}\approx 10^3$~cm$^{-3}$, and $d\rho_*/dt \propto \rho_{\rm gas}^{2.5}$ if $\overline n_{\rm gas}>n_{\rm cri}$. The duration of the star formation episode of roughly $6$ sound crossing times of the cloud radius (with $c_s=10$~km/s).  {\it iii}) For gas at solar metallicity the TSFE in the cloud is $f_*=2\% (m_{\rm gas}/10^4~M_\odot)^{0.4}(1+\overline n_{\rm gas}/n_{\rm cri})^{0.91}$, also in agreement with {\it (ii)}. At metallicity $Z<0.1$~Z$_\odot$, $f_*$ is reduced by a factor of $\sim$ 5, but this effect needs to be confirmed with larger samples.},
